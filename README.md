This project is a simple Simon Says Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a classic memory-based game where the player has to carefully observe and repeat a sequence of colors shown by the game. With each successful attempt, the sequence grows longer, making the challenge more exciting and engaging. The game is designed with four colored pads, each associated with a unique sound, giving it a fun and interactive experience. If the player makes a mistake by clicking the wrong color, the game ends and can be restarted to try again. This project focuses on improving skills in DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic using JavaScript, while CSS handles the styling and layout of the game interface. It is a great beginner-friendly project for practicing frontend development concepts and creating an interactive browser-based game.
